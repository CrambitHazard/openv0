# OpenV0 - AI-Powered Web App Generator

> Transform your ideas into fully functional websites with the power of AI

OpenV0 is an innovative AI-powered web application generator that allows users to create complete websites through natural language prompts. By leveraging the DeepSeek model via OpenRouter, users can describe their desired website and watch as the AI generates and executes a development plan in real-time.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Generation**: Uses DeepSeek model to create development plans and generate code
- **Real-time Preview**: Live preview of website generation with WebSocket updates
- **User API Key Management**: Secure handling of OpenRouter API keys
- **Step-by-step Execution**: Transparent process showing each development step
- **Multiple Frameworks**: Support for React, Vue, and vanilla JavaScript
- **Project Management**: Save, edit, and manage your generated projects
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with modern UI/UX

## 🎯 Core Workflow

1. **API Key Setup**: User inputs their OpenRouter API key
2. **Model Connection**: System connects to DeepSeek model
3. **Prompt Input**: User describes desired website in natural language
4. **Plan Generation**: AI creates detailed development plan
5. **Step Execution**: System executes plan steps one by one
6. **Live Preview**: Real-time updates show progress and results
