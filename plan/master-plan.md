# Master Plan: AI-Powered Web App Generator (OpenV0)

## Project Overview
An AI-powered web application generator that allows users to input their OpenRouter API key and generate complete websites through natural language prompts. The system uses the DeepSeek model to create development plans and executes them step-by-step with live preview capabilities.

## Core Workflow
1. User inputs OpenRouter API key
2. System connects to deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free model
3. User describes desired website in prompt box
4. AI creates development plan
5. System executes plan step-by-step
6. Live preview updates in real-time
